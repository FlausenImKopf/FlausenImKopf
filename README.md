Hi, I’m Hanna 👋 

I'm an elementary–school-teacher-turned-software-engineer.

- Currently taking part in a bootcamp by @CodingBootcampsEurope
- Excited about learning HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js and more to be able to build beautiful, functional and inclusive websites
- I'm looking forward to hopefully starting as a junior web developer in Augsburg, Germany after I complete the bootcamp. Preferably in an office, so I can learn faster and have more of an impact on the projects I'm going to be contributing to.
