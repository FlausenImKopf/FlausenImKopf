Hi, I’m Hanna 👋 

I'm an elementary–school-teacher-turned-software-engineer.

- Currently taking part in a bootcamp by [@CodingBootcampsEurope](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu)
- Excited about learning HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js and more to be able to build beautiful, functional and inclusive websites
- I'm looking forward to starting as a junior developer in Augsburg, Germany after I complete the bootcamp. Preferably in an office or hybrid, so I can learn faster and have more of an impact on the projects I'm going to be contributing to.

Let's connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanna-meichelboeck/

Some of my favourite projects from my time at the bootcamp: 

- [Photo Card](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/photo-card): my first responsive website
- [Codewars Katas](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/codewars-katas): fun challenges in JavaScript
- [Todo-App with REST](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/restful-backends): final form of the todo app, using a restful backend
- [Learning Vue](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/vue): a lot of small exercises to get familiar with Vue
- Final Vue.js project: coming soon!
