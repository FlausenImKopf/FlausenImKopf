Hi, I’m Hanna 👋 

I'm an elementary–school-teacher-turned-software-engineer.

- taught myself some python a while back and got fascinated by microcontrollers
- did a bootcamp by [@CodingBootcampsEurope](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu) and learned to love web dev and the frontend
- now about to study technical computer science in Augsburg

Let's connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanna-meichelboeck/

Some of my favourite projects from my time at the bootcamp: 

- [Photo Card](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/photo-card): my first responsive website
- [Codewars Katas](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/codewars-katas): fun challenges in JavaScript
- [Todo-App with REST](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/restful-backends/tree/main/todo-app-with-todo-api): final form of the todo app, using a restful backend
- [Learning Vue](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/vue): a lot of small exercises to get familiar with Vue
- [Glimmer App](https://github.com/FlausenImKopf/glimmer): final bootcamp project
